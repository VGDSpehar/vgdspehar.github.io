Hey hey !

This is my first post to document my journey for **Google Summer of Code 2025**.

After going through the different organisations selected to participate in GSOC 2025, Freifunk peaked my interest (I was just coming back from a trip to Germany and discovered about them during my trip) with a special mention for the project proposed by Javier Jorge titled : *Adding Wi-Fi Support to QEMU Simulations in LibreMesh*. 

Linux, QEMU, OpenWrt, all that on a background of a distributed system, bundled in one project ? Every one of my subjects of predilection all in one project : that's my luck ! 

I was already familiar with different mesh projects such as Meshtastic (lora based mesh network) and obviously heard about Guifi.net but it was my first time hearing about LibreMesh, and I must say I find it a fantastic project and I hope to see it deployed in Paris very soon ! Something like "panamesh" would sound great ? First I need to convince my lora peers!

## üß† About the Project

The idea is to bring Wi-Fi virtualization capabilities to LibreMesh through QEMU, using the Linux kernel module `mac80211_hwsim`. This would allow for:

- Lighter, faster, and more flexible testing (no need to setup physical hardware anymore)
- Simulating different kinds of topology
- Introducing controlled packet loss and experimentating on it
- Extension of this could include : roaming simulation, adding (virtually) physical obstacle and much more.

I believe this could be really interesting for LibreMesh and could lead to some interesting experimentations !
